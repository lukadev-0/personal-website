I've been using the "L in circle" for quite a while now, so I thought its time for a refresh.

import { Image } from "astro:assets";
import rebrand from "../../assets/blog/a-new-look/rebrand.svg";

<Image src={rebrand} alt="a comparison of the old and new logo" />

The new logo features a combination of the L and D letters from **L**uka**D**ev, its thicker than
the previous logo and the font of the text has been changed to Plus Jakarta Sans and has been made
bolder.

I've also adapted a full lowercase look for the logo as well as the website. A lot of the text in
this website has been turned into all lowercase, which I think looks pretty neat.
