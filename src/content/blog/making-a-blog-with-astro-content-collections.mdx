So I added a blog to my website.

This blog uses the [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections)
feature introduced in version 2.0.0 of [Astro](https://astro.build), the framework I used for this website.

## What are Content Collections

Content Collections are a way to manage, well... content! In this case a blog.

It manages reading all the files, parsing the frontmatter in the markdown,
and rendering the markdown itself into HTML. It's quite similar to
[Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/).

Content Collections allow you to define a schema for the frontmatter using [Zod](https://zod.dev/),
which is an amazing schema validation library that infers TypeScript types from your schema.

If you're wondering what frontmatter is, it's basically a way to attach metadata, such as the title
or description to a markdown document.

# Making a blog with Astro Content Collections
```

## The `astro:content` module

In order to retrieve our blog posts and the additional frontmatter we defined, we can use the
`astro:content` module, which exposes functions like `getCollection()` and `getEntry()` that allows
us to fetch the content.

The parameter and return values of these functions are automatically inferred based on the Zod schema,
giving us autocomplete and typechecking.

## Implementing it into the site

Implementing all this was quite easy! I used [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) instead of regular markdown,
which will allow me to add extra elements using JSX if I need to.

I placed all the blog posts within the `src/content/blog` directory, and then I defined the schema
for the frontmatter within `src/content/config.ts`.

```ts
import { z, defineCollection } from "astro:content";

// Create a content collection for the blog
const blogCollection = defineCollection({
  type: "content",

  // Zod schema to validate the frontmatter
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    date: z.date(),
  }),
});

// Export an object containing all the collections
export const collections = {
  blog: blogCollection,
};
```

In order to generate the [`/blog`](/blog) page with the list of posts, I used the `getCollection()`
function and mapped over the result.

```astro
---
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";

// Returns an array of objects containing
// information about each post.
const allBlogPosts = (await getCollection("blog"))
  // Sort the posts by time from newest to oldest
  .sort((a, b) => b.data.date.getTime() - a.data.date.getTime());
---

<main>
  {allBlogPosts.map(post => (
    <article>
        <h2>
            <a href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</a>
        </h2>
        <p>{post.description}</p>
    </article>
  ))}
</main>
```

To implement the individual pages for each blog post, I created a file at `src/pages/blog/[...slug].astro`
and used Astro's [`getStaticPaths()`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#getstaticpaths)
function, which allows you to dynamically create pages from data.

To render the post I used the `post.render()` function, which returns an object with a `Content` component
containing the rendered HTML of the post.

```astro
---
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const allBlogPosts = await getCollection("blog");
  return allBlogPosts.map(post => ({
    params: { slug: post.slug }, props: { post },
  }));
}

const { post } = Astro.props;
const { Content } = await post.render();
---

<Content />
```

And that's it!
